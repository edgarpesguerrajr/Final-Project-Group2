## Description
A menu-driven program with a command line interface (CLI) that prints and generates transcripts of a student into text files. Registered students are listed in a CSV file with the filename 'studentDetails.csv'. Each student has another CSV file with a filename of their student ID (e.g., 2021-05794-MN-0.csv) where their grades are listed. The program reads and filters information in the CSV files based on the student information given by the user. Each request creates a text file where the information requested is saved. Each request is recorded in history via the 'previous requests feature' with a date and time in which the request was made.
